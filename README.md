# RestakeLP-Hook
RestakeLP Hook is a Uniswap V4 hook that eliminates the opportunity cost between liquidity provision and restaking by automatically restaking the ETH portion of LP positions to chosen EigenLayer AVS operators. This creates a triple yield mechanism: traditional LP rewards, trading fees, and AVS staking rewards with automated slashing protection.
